    These are plugins that can transpile bundle emitted by ESBuild and also compatible with core-js@3.
    Some plugins included by @babel/preset-env will break core-js@3 for Symbol, so we select plugin carefully.

    List of plugins included by @babel/preset-env:
    https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-compat-data/scripts/data/plugin-features.js

    If we use @babel/preset-env on the bundle emitted by ESBuild, it will cause this issue.
    https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/issues/514

    The solution is to skip Babel on node_modules/core-js. But in our case, we can't because it is already in the final bundle.
